Clojure DSL resources
=====================
This is a curated list of mostly mature and/or actively developed Clojure resources relevant for dealing with domain-specific languages, in particular parsing and data transformation with/of DSLs. The list is currently being expanded as I explore this area more thoroughly. Suggestions are welcome in the form of pull requests or Github issues. I try to steer around abandonware, though.

> If you're interested in graphs and data modelling, be sure to check out [clojure-graph-resources](https://github.com/simongray/clojure-graph-resources) too.

Domain-specific languages
-------------------------
Lisp dialects traditionally make heavy use of macros to rewrite source code at compile time, opening the DSL floodgates. Somewhat unique to Clojure is a strong emphasis on using the core data literals to form DSLs. In either case, a supposed DSL could just as easily be considered a creative use of existing language features or a particularly well-designed API.

Data-oriented configuration
---------------------------
In most Clojure software there is a guiding principle of _data > functions > macros_. It has resulted in a convention of using mostly data structures to configure the behaviour of systems. This practice has also led to frequent repurposing of data structures. In many cases, the repurposing crosses into a grey zone somewhere between a DSL and idiomatic use.
